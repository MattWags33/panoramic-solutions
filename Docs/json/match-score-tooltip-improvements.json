  "feature": {
    "name": "Match Score Tooltip Improvements",
    "description": "Enhanced the match score tooltip in the tools section to make it easier to interact with by expanding the clickable area to include the entire 'N/A ? Match Score' label",
    "issue": "The tooltip was difficult to select because only the 'N/A ?' part was clickable, not the 'Match Score' text",
    "solution": "Added an includeLabel prop to MatchScoreTooltip component that wraps the entire area including 'Match Score' text in the tooltip trigger"
  },
  "changes": [
    {
      "file": "src/ppm-tool/components/ui/MatchScoreTooltip.tsx",
      "type": "ENHANCEMENT",
      "description": "Added includeLabel prop to optionally include 'Match Score' text in the clickable tooltip trigger area",
      "changes_detail": [
        "Added includeLabel?: boolean prop to interface (defaults to false for backwards compatibility)",
        "Modified trigger div to conditionally render 'Match Score' text when includeLabel=true",
        "Added active:bg-gray-200 class for better touch feedback on mobile devices",
        "Maintained existing hover functionality via MobileTooltip which already supports desktop hover"
      ]
    },
    {
      "file": "src/ppm-tool/components/cards/EnhancedCompactToolCard.tsx",
      "type": "ENHANCEMENT",
      "description": "Updated to use the new includeLabel prop, making entire match score area clickable",
      "changes_detail": [
        "Set includeLabel={true} on MatchScoreTooltip component (line 148)",
        "Removed duplicate 'Match Score' span that was previously outside the tooltip wrapper",
        "Result: entire 'N/A ? Match Score' badge is now clickable for tooltip interaction"
      ]
    }

  "benefits": [
    {
      "benefit": "Larger touch target",
      "description": "Entire 'N/A ? Match Score' area is now clickable, making it easier to tap on mobile and touchscreen devices"
    },
    {
      "benefit": "Desktop hover support",
      "description": "MobileTooltip component already provides automatic hover functionality on desktop via BasicHoverTooltip, so desktop users can now hover over the entire match score area"
    },
    {
      "benefit": "Better UX consistency",
      "description": "The clickable area now visually matches what users expect to be interactive (the entire badge)"
    },
    {
      "benefit": "Backwards compatible",
      "description": "The includeLabel prop defaults to false, so any other uses of MatchScoreTooltip remain unchanged"
    },
    {
      "benefit": "Cross-device support",
      "description": "Works consistently across mobile phones, touchscreen laptops, and desktop computers"

    "desktop": "Hover over the 'N/A ? Match Score' badge to see the tooltip appear automatically",
    "keyboard": "Tab to focus on the badge and it should show the tooltip (via MobileTooltip's focus handlers)"
  },
  "tooltip_behavior": {
    "mobile_phones_tablets": "Click to toggle tooltip, auto-closes after 4 seconds or when clicking outside",
    "touchscreen_laptops": "Hybrid mode - hover shows tooltip, click toggles it for touch interactions",
    "desktop": "Hover shows tooltip automatically with no click required"
